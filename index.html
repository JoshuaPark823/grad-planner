                    gradPlanner.io was built for the purpose of helping McGill students plan their inevitable graduation.
                    Aside from the base HTML/CSS and JS web functionality, student information is stored in a 2D-matrix
                    inside the underlying javascript! Currently, this paragraph is fully being used as a placeholder until
                    I manage to write up an actual description. Needless to say, I'm still deciding whether to pursue a
                    short and simple paragraph over an extremely verbose one. Alas, I am undecided. Have fun friends. </br></br>
