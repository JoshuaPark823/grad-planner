## gradPlanner.io Website Source Code

- This is the source code for my first web project, gradPlanner.io.

## What is gradPlanner.io?

- gradPlanner.io is a website built from simplistic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the goal of helping McGill students better plan </br>
their degrees.

## Notable Points:

- A portion of the Student Data (semesters and courses enrolled) are stored in a two-dimensional matrix with the outer elements </br>
representing semesters and the inner elements representing the courses. This allowed for both fast and accessible storage of student
</br> data. 

## Difficulties:

- Considering this was my first web project, I dove immediately into throwing a bunch of HTML together, styling it with CSS, and </br>
adding tons of JavaScript functionality between the HTML/JS DOM.
- However, the lack of planning and surplus of excitement lead to a lot of code refactoring as the project went on and got larger.

## Solutions:

- I took a step back, went a little old school, and wrote each JS method and the stack trace of function calls on a piece of paper. </br>
By planning out the structure of my functions and HTML elements, I was able to much better understand and grasp the relationship between
</br> HTML and JavaScript.
