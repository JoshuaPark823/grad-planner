# Grad Planner Web Project

### Overview
- Build a web application using vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS that builds a structure for a student's graduation at McGill. Currently credits are weighted equally (1/2/4 Credit courses aren't available). 
- Create a responsive frontend UI with out using any frameworks, libraries, or advanced JavaScript technologies.

### Languages & Technologies
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript ES6

### Possible Future Additions
- Refactor the JavaScript codebase using jQuery, selectors, etc.
- Implement **Responsive Design** either using CSS3 media queries or webkit. 

### Hurdles & Solutions

- Considering this was my first web project, I dove immediately into throwing a bunch of HTML together, styling it with CSS, and adding tons of JavaScript functionality between the HTML/JS DOM.
- However, the lack of planning and surplus of excitement lead to a lot of code refactoring as the project went on and got larger. </br> </br>

- Solutions:
  - I took a step back, went a little old school, and wrote each JS method and the stack trace of function calls on a piece of paper. By planning out the structure of my functions and HTML elements, I was able to much better understand and grasp the relationship between HTML and JavaScript.
